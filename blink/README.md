## Problem:
http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=279

## Intuition:
This problem can be solved by either brute force nested for loop or more advanced bit manipulation, which I think isn't that helpful in terms of preparing high schoolers who are intersted in this program. The problem is essentially looping through the all lightbulbs and change their states for every unit of time and return the final result when we have successfully simulated b units of time.

## Run time: 
O(nb) where n is the number of light bulbs and b is the time elapsed.
